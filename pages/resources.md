## Quantified
For the past four years, I've been diving deep SQL. Once Covid hit, I started sharing SQL queries that allow you to query your Shopify data on [Quantified.blog](https://quantified.blog). I haven't updated in a bit, but there's enough there to get you started.

If you want to chat anything data, reporting, you name it. [Don't hestitate to reach out](/contact/).
