# Welcome

Hi, I'm Matt Bahr. Iâ€™m the founder & CEO of [EnquireLabs](https://enquirelabs.com). We're building a customer data platform powered by qualitative data. We went to market with a focus on attribution surveys (how did you hear about us?) and now serve over 3 million surveys a month. 

If you work in the DTC or ecommerce space, don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/)!
