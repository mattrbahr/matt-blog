My main gig is as the founder & CEO of [EnquireLabs](https://enquirelabs.com/), we're a Shopify app that enables merchants to collect qualitative data from their customers. I started my career in ecommerce about a decade ago and have had stints on both the merchant and technology side of the equation. 

Along with running EnquireLabs, I currently advise and consult for wide range of companies, from direct-to-consumer brands to public companies. 

I currently reside in New York, NY. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, chess (add me on chess.com, mrbahr), playing music (guitar/piano), and cooking.
