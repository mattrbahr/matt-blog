Hi, I’m Matt Bahr. I’m the founder & CEO of [EnquireLabs](https://enquirelabs.com/) where our mission is to power every attribution survey (i.e. “how did you hear about us?”) on the Internet. We currently serve over 2 million surveys per month.

I also advise and consult for wide range of companies, from direct-to-consumer brands to large public companies. Prior to founding EnquireLabs, I was an early employee at [Master & Dynamic](https://masterdynamic.com/), a DTC premium headphone company.

I currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing music (guitar/piano), chess (add me on chess.com, mrbahr), and cooking.
