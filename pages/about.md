My main gig is as the founder & CEO of [EnquireLabs](https://enquirelabs.com/), we're a Shopify app that enables merchants to collect qualitative data from their customers post-purchase. My career in ecommerce started a decade ago. Up until EnquireLabs, I was on the merchant (brand) side, leading all things digital and growth.

Along with running EnquireLabs, I currently advise and consult for wide range of companies, from direct-to-consumer brands to public companies. 

I currently reside in New York, NY.
