summary: When was the last time you logged into a DTC's brand's website?

For me, it's been a while. When I'm logged in, the brand or online store knows exactly who I am and what I've purchased before, yet there's rarely any value after entering my username and password.

Shopify, the platform most of these DTC brands operate on, hasn't made it easy to reduce log-in friction either. Their focus on Shop Pay at checkout and not higher up on the funnel means users still need to log-in with a username and password. Their mobile app, Shop, in the near future may start providing more value to your existing customers than you can. 

Over the years, website personalization in ecommerce has morphed into a solution predicated on watching not listening to users. First we take every user action, page-view, click, transaction, etc, and push it into a black-box. In-return we get personalized product recommendations and automated discounting. The "magic" has never really felt quite magical.

As transactions move online, communication between store and customer dwindle. 1:1 relationships are no longer feasible. Product recommendations pre-internet weren't powered by complex algorithms but by store associates knowing a long-time customers likes and interests. 

## Incentivizing User Log In

Stores have an opportunity to build better relationships and trust by creating better experiences for users who are logged in. Offer exclusive discount codes on account pages, pre-launch products only available to users who are logged-in, increase return window for loyal users, the list goes on.

Right now, being part of brands' community, means following them on social and subscribing to their email list.   Exclusivity on both channels seems forged. By building more interactive logged-in sates, your customers will have the opportunity to interact with you in a way they couldn't have otherwise.

The best example I've personally seen of a great logged-in experience is Mack Weldon's. They clearly invested a lot of time and resources to optimize the account pages for repeat buyers.

Their investment in a customer loyalty program and clearly communicating how it work is very much working (anecdotally, at least). The value is enough that I log in every time I go to the site.

They could push this experience to the next level by surfacing further information about their program and my past purchase behavior throughout the site. A great example of this would be to show my previous purchased size on PDPs. Bonobos does an exceptional job at this.

## Outline

* The ecommerce era have made 1:1 relationships are a thing of the past
  		* Examples local store clerk and Nordstroms
* At EnquireLabs, we preach participatory marketing, the idea that you should market with your customers, not at them.
  		 *Participartory marketing is this concept of advertising with your customers, rather than at them.* 
  		 How do you build relationships with your customers if they're just to a session on your site? 
* Build a closer connection by talking to your customer and tailoring their experience their needs.
  		 *This* tailorization* is often referred to as personalization. THe majority of personalization tech today, takes previous cookied browser behavior and "personalizes" the user experience based on some blackbox optimization algorithm. User viewed X, show them Y.

## Log-In Data

* Pull data from Shopify stores and show how often users are logging in
* Or even have an account for that matter

## Incentive User Log-in

When was the last time you were encouraged to log-in to an ecommerce website other than Amazon (or the like)? The DTC brands I'm a repeat customer at, I do not log-in prior to purchasing again, I simply add items to my cart and check-out.

## Implementation

No one wants to remember their password to your brand website.

Don't force user log-in, but make it desirable. 

Back in ~2012, forcing users to log-in was very common practice (find example). The pitch was undoubtably to give brands more data about who their customers were to allow them to better market to them. The *why* was never truly explained to the consumer out side of "create an account to proceed". 

There are plenty user-login apps on Shopify. 

Domm at Fast is focusing on solving this problem. Reduce friction. 

* Increase speed of log-in
