For me, it's been a while. When I'm logged in, the brand or online store knows exactly who I am and what I've purchased before, yet there's rarely any value after entering my username and password.

Shopify, the platform most of these DTC brands operate on, hasn't made it easy to reduce log-in friction either. Their focus on Shop Pay at checkout and not higher up on the funnel means users still need to log-in with a username and password. Their mobile app, Shop, in the near future may start providing more value to your existing customers than you can. 

Over the years, website personalization in ecommerce has morphed into a solution predicated on watching not listening to users. First we take every user action, page-view, click, transaction, etc, and push it into a black-box. In-return we get personalized product recommendations and automated discounting. The "magic" has never really felt quite magical.

As transactions move online, communication between store and customer dwindle. 1:1 relationships are no longer feasible. Product recommendations pre-internet weren't powered by complex algorithms but by store associates knowing a long-time customers likes and interests. 

## Incentivizing User Log In

Stores have an opportunity to build better relationships and trust by creating better experiences for users who are logged in. Offer exclusive discount codes on account pages, pre-launch products only available to users who are logged-in, increase return window for loyal users, the list goes on.

Right now, being part of brands' community, means following them on social and subscribing to their email list.   Exclusivity on both channels seems forged. By building more interactive logged-in sates, your customers will have the opportunity to interact with you in a way they couldn't have otherwise.

The best example I've personally seen of a great logged-in experience is Mack Weldon's. They clearly invested a lot of time and resources to optimize the account pages for repeat buyers.

Their investment in a customer loyalty program and clearly communicating how it work is very much working (anecdotally, at least). The value is enough that I log in every time I go to the site.

They could push this experience to the next level by surfacing further information about their program and my past purchase behavior throughout the site. A great example of this would be to show my previous purchased size on PDPs. Bonobos does an exceptional job at this -- select your fit and the entire site is personalized to only show you what's in stock that fits you.

## Learn By Asking

Knowing why someone bought from you or who a purchase was for will certainly help you build better relationships and market to your customers. Walk into a store and you may hear "Who are you shopping for?". Post purchase, brands have the ability to ask these questions directly on the account page. Was this purchase a gift? Is this your size? Would you purchase this if we create it? The list goes on. 

## Log-in Friction

Log-in friction still needs to be reduced. Companies like [Fast](https://fast.co) are certainly focused on doing this as they see the value in allowing consumers to never have to remember another password again. Until then, build a better account experience and customers will remember their passwords. They certainly do for Amazon. 

## Logged-In User Personalization Ideas

The below is a list of ideas you can implement to customize the user experience once a user is logged-in. All except product recommendations don't involve complex 

* **Personalized return policy:** provide loyal users with personalized return policies. I've chatted in length about this with [Liesl Chang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lieslchang/). Opportunity to change returns from cost center to profit center.
* **My Fit:** allow users to enter their fit information, then personalize the front-end shopping experience to what's available in their size.
* **Current Promotions:** display current live promotions to users directly in their account page. Contrary to these living in emails, if users are in a buying mode they log-in to your site to see any deals.
* **Access to Exclusive Products:** create a deeper sense of exclusivity by creating collections only accessible to those who create accounts and are logged-in. 
* **Provide Faster Shipping Times to Loyal Customers:** log-in to know when items will be delivered to you.
* **Collect Addition Preferences:** instead of tracking user behavior simply ask them their preferences. They'll be grateful for it if it's clear why you're asking.

### Increase Marketing Attribution Accuracy

If implemented correctly, well executed account pages are a win-win. You can build a stronger connection to your customers and you'll also be given a new data set that makes marketing attribution much easier. I rarely see GA's User-ID view implemented given there's little value in doing soâ€“no one logs in! By incentivizing user-login, a users path-to-purchase will become all the much clearer given we won't be using misleading cookie or device data to build the user journey, we can transform `user_id: 39391` into "Mary Smith".
