When was the last time you logged into a DTC's brand's website? Why would you? If you're like me, you're most likely always logged into Amazon. There's little reason why you would ever log-in to a DTC's brands website, there's no incentive to do so.

Ecommerce has turned people into pixels. 

Building 1:1 relationships at scale is difficult, borderline impossible. A bygone era involved a connection between store clerk and consumer, with ecommerce that's certainly disipated. Customers have evolved from Mary Smith to `Customer ID 234293`. 	

Sell users on becoming part of your community.
Create products your community loves and convert them to customers.
Build an experience for your customers.

## Outline

* The ecommerce era have made 1:1 relationships are a thing of the past
  		* Examples local store clerk and Nordstroms
* At EnquireLabs, we preach participatory marketing, the idea that you should market with your customers, not at them.
  		 *Participartory marketing is this concept of advertising with your customers, rather than at them.* 
  		 How do you build relationships with your customers if they're just to a session on your site? 
* Build a closer connection by talking to your customer and tailoring their experience their needs.
  		 *This* tailorization* is often referred to as personalization. THe majority of personalization tech today, takes previous cookied browser behavior and "personalizes" the user experience based on some blackbox optimization algorithm. User viewed X, show them Y.

## Log-In Data

* Pull data from Shopify stores and show how often users are logging in
* Or even have an account for that matter

## Incentive User Log-in

When was the last time you were encouraged to log-in to an ecommerce website other than Amazon (or the like)? The DTC brands I'm a repeat customer at, I do not log-in prior to purchasing again, I simply add items to my cart and check-out.

## Implementation

No one wants to remember their password to your brand website.

Don't force user log-in, but make it desirable. 

Back in ~2012, forcing users to log-in was very common practice (find example). The pitch was undoubtably to give brands more data about who their customers were to allow them to better market to them. The *why* was never truly explained to the consumer out side of "create an account to proceed". 

There are plenty user-login apps on Shopify. 

Domm at Fast is focusing on solving this problem. Reduce friction. 

* Increase speed of log-in
  			 *H/T to @Fast* 
  				 Fast alternatives (Apple Log-in, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
  				* Sign-in with Facebook attempted to solve this

## Data Collection

Drive home participatory marketing. Market to people over pixels. 

Ask relevant questions, build relationships and personalizated experiences. 

Take `user_id: 39391` and turn that into Mary Smith.
